# webpack-demo

## Description
This project is a demonstration of using Webpack for bundling JavaScript applications. It showcases how to set up a basic Webpack configuration and serves as a starting point for more complex applications.

## Installation
To install the project, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

## Usage
To bundle the application, use the following command:
